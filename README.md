# Deque_task

Your task is to **recall the logic we used** to implement 
the `BrowserHistory` class and **implement it using the** `Deque`
data structure.
An interface **with all the methods** has **been created**
in the `codefinity.Task` package.
Your task is to create a **class implementation** 
and **implement this interface** by *overriding* all its methods. 

Once you finish, **run the tests** that I have written for you;
it will automatically check your solution.

You can also **perform intermediate tests** in the `main` class. 
Overall, I rely on your honesty and independence.
A true programmer should be able to understand code independently! 
Good luck!
